        3. If serious: Clearly state to seek immediate medical attention
        Do not bolden or italicise words(this is a must)
        Keep the response concise and direct. I don't want a heading. I want the small paragraph to start with the name
        of the most probable disease and then goes on to explain about it in a short paragraph.(for example, if it is a fever then :
        "Common Cold is the most common type of...")(do not make this part pointwise. I want the first part to be in a small paragraph or sentence)
        if minor, then pointwise give steps to remedy and make it concise. If major, then direct to a hospital. Make the response smaller and more compact and the first paragraph should just give important info and not this huge paragraph`;
